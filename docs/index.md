## HA Custom Analytics

This webpage contains some of the latest Home Assistant Analytics data

The automated data collection in this repository is done each 6 hours.

Please refer to the [README](https://github.com/Vaskivskyi/ha-custom-analytics) for the detailed info.

## Usage

#### Shields.io badges

You can use these generated files in the following way (or check the [official Shields documentation](https://shields.io/endpoint)):

```
https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=YOUR_ENDPOINT
```

If you would like to use already generated data, use the following endpoints:

```
https://vaskivskyi.github.io/ha-custom-analytics/badges/INTEGRATION_NAME/total.json

https://vaskivskyi.github.io/ha-custom-analytics/badges/INTEGRATION_NAME/version-VERSION.json
```

Example for a badge of my `asusrouter` integration:

```
https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://vaskivskyi.github.io/ha-custom-analytics/badges/asusrouter/total.json
```

![AsusRouter installations](https://img.shields.io/endpoint?url=https://vaskivskyi.github.io/ha-custom-analytics/badges/asusrouter/total.json)

All the styles are available as for any other Shields badges.
